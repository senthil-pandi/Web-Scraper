# Web-Scraper
This is a python Script to Scrap the top news with more than 99 votes from the hacker news website. This will save the time of us to manually go and search for the top news.

Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. The web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser.

In this project I have scraped the https://news.ycombinator.com/ website to filter the top news which got more than 99 votes. 

You can understand the concept from this script and replicate it according to your needs. 

Before Scraping a website, make sure you read the 'robots.txt' file to know what things you are allowed to scrap in that website.
